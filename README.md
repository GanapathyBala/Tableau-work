I have completed building a Customer Complaint Dashboard in Tableau, designed to provide insightful analytics and help businesses improve customer satisfaction. The dashboard seamlessly integrates two datasets to offer a comprehensive view of customer complaints and their resolutions.

📊 Key Highlights of the Project:

Merged [Dataset A] (e.g., Customer Complaints) with [Dataset B] (e.g., Resolution Metrics) to create a unified dashboard.
Features include:
📍 Complaint Trends by Region
⏳ Average Resolution Time Analysis
📈 Customer Feedback Sentiment Over Time
🏆 KPI Metrics to Track Performance
Ensured the dashboard is user-friendly, interactive, and tailored for decision-makers.
